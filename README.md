# is-gatsby
A simple browser extension to tell if a site/page is built using Gatsby.

This is just a one line function to check if there's an element with id `___gatsby` in the page and changing the icon accordingly.

Feel free to create an issue to discuss if you think this extension can help with anything else related to Gatsby!
